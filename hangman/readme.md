Code Explanation:

1. The code starts by importing the random module.
2. This module provides a way to generate random numbers.
3. Next, the code creates someWords, which is a list of fruit names.
4. The list is split into spaces using the string ‘ ‘, and then each space is replaced with a letter.
5. Next, the code randomly selects a secret word from our someWords list.
6. This word will be used as the input for the game later on.
7. The next part of the code checks to see if the user has entered an alpha character (a letter that appears in front of other letters).
8. If not, then they are asked to enter only a letter.
9. If they enter an alpha character, then it’s assumed that they want to guess at another letter in word .
10. So, this part of the code checks to see if guess matches one of the letters in word .
11. If it does, then chances is updated and flag is set to 1 .
12. Otherwise, chances is decreased by 1 and flag remains at 0 .
13. The next part of the code tries to guess at another letter in word .
14. If guess isn’t valid (i.e., it doesn’t match any of the letters in word ), then print() prints out all empty spaces for letters in word , and
15. The code starts by importing the random module.
16. This module provides us with a number of useful functions, one of which is the choice function.
17. This function allows us to randomly choose a secret word from our list of words.
18. Next, we create some variables which will be used throughout the program.
19. These include someWords , word and letterGuessed .
20. letterGuessed will store the letter guessed by the player, while chances will store the number of times that the player has correctly guessed the word so far.correct will keep track of how many letters have been guessed so far and flag will indicate whether or not the player has guessed the word correctly.
21. We then start looping through our list of words and randomly choosing a secret word from it.
